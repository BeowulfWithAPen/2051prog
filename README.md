# 2051prog
Repurposing Arduino NANO to program a 2051 microcontroller

-- HEADER --
  this program is meant to accept a hex file stored on an SD card and write the contents into the flash memory of a 2051 microcontroller.
The system can be operated on it's own from an external 12V power source, with th option to be hooked up to a PC for further debugging. 
  
-- REQUIRED HARDWARE --
  * 1 Arduino NANO 
  * 1 PNP and 1 NPN transistor
  * minimum 5 Resistors
  * 1 SD card Module
  * minimum 2 LEDs (for error codes)
  * 12V power source, must be able to splice to breadboard power lines
